#Features:
Add a new student
Display all students
Search student by roll number
Remove student by roll number
Show class topper based on total marks

Input validation using exception handling


#Core Concepts & Tools:
   Python 3
   Nested Dictionary
   Tuple (for marks storage)
   Set (for unique sections)
   While loop and conditional statements
   Try-Except for error handling
#Data Structure:
   Student data is stored in the following format:
  students = { roll_number: { "name": string, "age": integer, "marks": (sub1, sub2, sub3), "section": string } }
  This structure allows efficient searching, updating, and deletion of student records.
#Learning Outcomes:
  Understanding nested dictionaries
  Looping through dictionaries using items() and values()
  Finding maximum value (class topper logic)
  Using sets to store unique data
  Handling invalid input using exception handling
